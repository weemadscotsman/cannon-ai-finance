## Tweet #1 (Launch)

I built an AI finance app that actually talks to you about your money.

Not dashboards. Not charts. 

A VOICE that knows your budget and tells you what you're doing wrong.

Free tier: 50 AI interactions

## Tweet #2 (Story/Hook)
```
My brain is chaos.

I have 4 side projects, 3 income streams, and money leaks everywhere.

Built this because YNAB made me want to die and Mint shut down.

It roasts my spending habits in real-time. 

Game changer.

Show IH: I built an AI finance coach that talks to you (literally)
```

## Indie Hackers Post Body
```
**The Problem:**
I have ADHD and multiple side projects. Traditional budgeting apps are too rigid. I needed something that could handle chaos and actually TALK to me about my money.

**The Solution:**
Built CANN.ON.AI Finance - an AI that:
- Tracks expenses with 50+ categories
- Generates financial strategy on demand
- Has LIVE VOICE conversations about your budget
- Actually knows your spending patterns

**The Hook:**
Free tier gets 50 AI interactions. Hit the limit and you'll want to upgrade. The voice coach feature is genuinely addictive.

**Tech Stack:**
React + TypeScript + Vite + Gemini API

**Ask:**
Try the free tier. Break it. Tell me what confused you.

## Reddit r/ADHD Post
```
ADHD-friendly finance tracker with AI voice coach

Built this because every budgeting app assumes you have executive function (lol).

Features that actually work for chaotic brains:
- Voice AI explains your spending (no reading charts)
- 50+ expense categories pre-loaded
- No guilt-trip notifications
- AI generates "here's what to cut" lists

Free tier available. Would love feedback from fellow chaos agents.
